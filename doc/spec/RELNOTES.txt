	 JavaBeans(tm) Activation Framework 1.2 Release Notes

Welcome to the JavaBeans(tm) Activation Framework!

System Requirements:
--------------------

The JavaBeans(tm) Activation Framework (JAF) was developed and tested
against JDK 1.5.  JAF is written in Java (with no native code).  It
will run on any JDK 1.5 (or newer) compatible virtual machine.

Note that JAF is included in Java SE 6 and later releases.

Installation:
-------------

There is effectively *no* installation of the JAF. The classes that
make up the JAF are contained in the included Java(tm) Archive (JAR) file,
"jakarta.activation.jar". This file can be placed anywhere accessible to the
Java virtual machine running on your system. The only requirement is
that the jakarta.activation.jar be included in your system's class path so
Java can find the JAF classes.

Related Web Sites:
------------------

There are a number of web sites you might find useful if you haven't
already run across them:

https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/javamail -- The JavaMail(tm) API provides a set
                             of abstract classes that model a mail system.
                             Its implementation is dependent on the JAF.
