		Jakarta Activation Framework 2.1
		==================================

Jakarta Activation 2.1 breaks the tight integration between the Jakarta Activation specification API
and Jakarta Activation implementation  Following is
a description of the changes that are being introduced in Jakarta Activation 2.1.
The numbers in parentheses are bug numbers; you can find more information
about the bug reports at:

    https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/issues

The Jakarta Activation 2.1 requires Java SE 8 or later.  Jakarta Activation 2.1 is
part of Jakarta EE 10.


===================================================================

1.  Add provider SPI
----------------------------------------------------------------

Add jakarta.activation.spi package with interfaces for the provider of the compatible implementation
of the Jakarta Activation Specification runtime to implement.

===================================================================

2.  Remove the implementation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation of the specification was moved to the new project - Eclipse Angus - and
further development continues there. Eclipse Angus is direct accessor of JavaActivation/JakartaActivation.

===================================================================

3.  Resource Loading Order
----------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid conflicts when both legacy and Jakarta Activation resources are
present in the classpath, Jakarta Activation 2.1 will now attempt to load
resources prefixed with `jakarta.` first if found.  

For example:
- `jakarta.mailcap` will be loaded instead of `mailcap`.
- `jakarta.mime.types` will be loaded instead of `mime.types`.

If the `jakarta.`-prefixed resource is not found, the framework will fall back
to the older resource file. This ensures backward compatibility with existing
applications while giving priority to Jakarta-specific resources.

Over time, the legacy resources without the `jakarta.` prefix may be removed,
leaving only the Jakarta-prefixed variants.
