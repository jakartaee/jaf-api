        Jakarta Activation Framework 2.2
        ==================================

Jakarta Activation 2.2 introduces changes in the way resource files are loaded
to better support coexistence with older versions and provide a smoother
migration path. Following is a description of the changes introduced in
Jakarta Activation 2.2. The numbers in parentheses are bug numbers; you can
find more information about the bug reports at:

    https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/issues

The Jakarta Activation 2.2 requires Java SE 11 or later.  Jakarta Activation 2.2
is part of Jakarta EE 12.


===================================================================

1.  Resource Loading Order
----------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid conflicts when both legacy and Jakarta Activation resources are
present in the classpath, Jakarta Activation 2.2 will now attempt to load
resources prefixed with `jakarta.` first if found.  

For example:
- `jakarta.mailcap` will be loaded instead of `mailcap`.
- `jakarta.mime.types` will be loaded instead of `mime.types`.

If the `jakarta.`-prefixed resource is not found, the framework will fall back
to the older resource file. This ensures backward compatibility with existing
applications while giving priority to Jakarta-specific resources.

Over time, the legacy resources without the `jakarta.` prefix may be removed,
leaving only the Jakarta-prefixed variants.
