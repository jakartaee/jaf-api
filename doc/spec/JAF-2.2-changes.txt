        Jakarta Activation Framework 2.2
        ==================================

Jakarta Activation 2.2 introduces changes in the way resource files are loaded
to better support coexistence with older versions and provide a smoother
migration path. Following is a description of the changes introduced in
Jakarta Activation 2.2. The numbers in parentheses are bug numbers; you can
find more information about the bug reports at:

The Jakarta Activation 2.2 requires Java SE 11 or later.  Jakarta Activation 2.2
is part of Jakarta EE 12.

1.  Resource Loading Order
----------------------------------------------------------------

To maintain backward compatibility while supporting Jakarta-prefixed resources, Jakarta Activation 2.2 now loads both legacy and Jakarta-prefixed resources when they are present in the classpath.

Legacy resources (without the jakarta. prefix) are given precedence if both forms exist.

Jakarta-prefixed resources (jakarta.*) are also loaded to support migration.

For example:

If both mailcap and jakarta.mailcap exist, the entries from mailcap are applied first.

If both mime.types and jakarta.mime.types exist, the entries from mime.types are applied first.

This ensures that existing applications using legacy resources continue to function correctly, while allowing Jakarta-prefixed resources to be used alongside them.

Over time, the legacy resources may be removed, leaving only the Jakarta-prefixed variants.
