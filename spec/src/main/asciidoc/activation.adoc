== Overview


JavaBeans™ is proving to be a popular technology. As
more people embrace JavaBeans™ and the Java™ platform, some of the
environment’s shortcomings are brought to light. JavaBeans™ was meant to
satisfy needs in builder and development environments but its
capabilities fall short of those needed to deploy stand alone components
as content editing and creating entities.

Neither JavaBeans™ nor the Java™ platform define a
consistent strategy for typing data, a method for determining the
supported data types of a software component, a method for binding typed
data to a component, or an architecture and implementation that supports
these features.

Presumably with these pieces in place, a developer can
write a JavaBeans™ based component that provides helper application like
functionality in a web browser, added functionality to an office suite,
or a content viewer in a Java™ application.

== Goals


This document describes Jakarta Activation.
Jakarta Activation implements the following services:

* It determines the type of arbitrary data.
* It encapsulates access to data.
* It discovers the operations available on a particular
type of data.
* It instantiates the software component that
corresponds to the desired operation on a particular piece of data.

Jakarta Activation is packaged as a Standard Extension to the
Java™ platform.

== Architectural Overview


The Java™ platform (including JavaBeans™) already
provides some support for a modest activation framework. Jakarta Activation
leverages as much of that existing technology as possible. Jakarta Activation
integrates these mechanisms.

image:activation.png[image]

This diagram shows the major elements comprising the
Jakarta Activation architecture.
Note that the framework shown here is not bound to a particular application.

=== The DataHandler Class

The DataHandler class (shown in the diagram above)
provides a consistent interface between Activation-aware clients and other
subsystems.

=== The DataSource Interface

The DataSource interface encapsulates an object that
contains data, and that can return both a stream providing data access,
and a string defining the MIME type describing the data.

Classes can be implemented for common data sources
(web, file system, IMAP, ftp, etc.). The DataSource interface can also
be extended to allow per data source user customizations. Once the
DataSource is set in the DataHandler, the client can determine the
operations available on that data.

Jakarta Activation includes two DataSource class implementations
for convenience:

* FileDataSource accesses data held in a file.
* URLDataSource accesses data held at a URL.

=== The CommandMap Interface

The CommandMap provides a service that allows consumers
of its interfaces to determine the ‘commands’ available on a particular
MIME type as well as an interface to retrieve an object that can operate
on an object of a particular MIME type (effectively a component
registry). The Command Map can generate and maintain a list of available
capabilities on a particular data type by a mechanism defined by the
implementation of the particular instance of the CommandMap.

The JavaBeans™ package provides the programming model
for the software components that implement the commands. Each JavaBeans™
component can use externalization, or can implement the CommandObject
interface to allow the typed data to be passed to it.

Jakarta Activation defines the CommandMap interface, which
provides a flexible and extensible framework for the CommandMap. The
CommandMap interface allows developers to develop their own solutions
for discovering which commands are available on the system. A possible
implementation can access the ‘types registry’ on the platform or use a
server-based solution. Jakarta Activation provides a simple default
solution based on RFC 1524 (.mailcap) like functionality.
See “Deliverables” below.

=== The Command Object Interface

Beans extend the CommandObject interface in order to
interact with Activation services.
Activation-aware JavaBeans™ components can directly
access their DataSource and DataHandler objects in order to retrieve the
data type and to act on the data.

== Using The Framework


We intend to make this infrastructure widely available
for any Java™ Application that needs this functionality. The ‘canonical’
consumer of this framework accesses it through the DataHandler (although
the major subsystems are designed to also operate independently). An
underlying DataSource object is associated with the DataHandler when the
DataHandler class is constructed.

* The DataHandler retrieves the data typing information
from the DataSource or gets the data type directly from the constructor.
* Once this initialization step is complete, a list of
commands that can be performed on the data item can be accessed from the
DataHandler.

When an application issues a request for this list, the
DataHandler uses the MIME data type specifier returned to request a list
of available commands from the CommandMap object. The CommandMap has
knowledge of available commands (implemented as Beans) and their
supported data types. The CommandMap returns a subset of the full list
of all commands based on the requested MIME type and the semantics of
the CommandMap implementation, to the DataHandler.

When the application wishes to apply a command to some
data, it is accomplished through the appropriate DataHandler interface,
which uses the CommandMap to retrieve the appropriate Bean that is used
to operate on the data. The container (user of the framework) makes the
association between the data and the Bean.

Application must use Jakarta Activation implementation that provides
MimeTypeRegistry, MailcapRegistry, MailcapRegistryProvider and
MimeTypeRegistryProvider implementations when the application wishes
to get access to the available MIME types and CommandMap whose configuration
is based on mailcap storage like mailcap files (RFC 1524).

== Usage Scenarios


This scenario uses the example of a hypothetical file
viewer application in order to illustrate the normal flow of tasks
involved when implementing Jakarta Activation. The file viewer is similar to the
Windows Explorer utility. When launched, it presents the user with a
display of available files. It includes a function like Explorer’s
‘right mouse’ menu, where all operations that can be performed on a
selected data item are listed in a popup menu for that item.

A typical user launches this application to view a
directory of files. When the user specifies a file by clicking on it,
the application displays a popup menu that lists the available
operations on that file. File system viewer utilities normally include
‘edit,’ ‘view,’ and ‘print’ commands as available operations. For
instance selecting ‘view’ causes the utility to open the selected file
in a viewer that can display data of the data type held in that file.

=== Scenario Architecture

Description of tasks performed by the application is
broken down into three discrete steps, for clarity:

* Initialization: The application constructs a view of
the file system.
* Getting the Command List: The application presents
the command list for a selected data item.
* Performing the Command: The application performs a
command on the selected data object.

=== Initialization

One of the interfaces mentioned below is the
‘DataSource’ object. Recall that the DataSource object encapsulates the
underlying data object in a class that abstracts the underlying data
storage mechanism, and presents its consumers with a common data access
and typing interface. The file viewer application queries the file
system for its contents.

The viewer instantiates a DataSource object for each
file in the directory. Then it instantiates a a DataHandler with the
DataSource as its constructor argument. The DataHandler object provides
the client application with access to the CommandMap, which provides a
service that enables access to commands that can operate on the data.
The application maintains a list of the DataHandler objects, queries
them for their names to generate its display.

[source, java]
----
// for each file in the directory:
Path file = Path.of(file_name);
DataSource ds = new FileDataSource(file);
DataHandler dh = new DataHandler(ds);
----

=== Getting the Command List

Once the application has been initialized and has
presented a list of files to the user, the user can select a file on the
list. When the user selects a file, the application displays a popup
menu that lists the available operations on that file.

The application implements this functionality by
requesting the list of available commands from the DataHandler object
associated with a file. The DataHandler retrieves the MIME type of the
data from the DataSource object and queries the CommandMap for
operations that are available on that type. The application interprets
the list and presents it to the user on a popup menu. The user then
selects one of the operations from that list.

Application can use CommandMap implementation that is provided by the
Jakarta Activation implementation or use the implementation that is
included in Jakarta Activation (MailcapCommandMap). When the second option
is used MimeTypeRegistry, MailcapRegistry, MailcapRegistryProvider and
MimeTypeRegistryProvider must be implemented by the Jakarta Activation
implementation.

[source, java]
----
// get the command list for an object
CommandInfo cmdInfo[] = dh.getPreferredCommands();

PopupMenu popup = new PopupMenu(“Item Menu”);

// populate the popup with available commands
for (i = 0; i < cmdInfo.length; i++)
    popup.add(cmdInfo[i].getCommandName());

// add and show popup
add(popup);
popup.show(x_pos, y_pos);
----

=== Performing a Command

After the user has selected a command from the popup
menu, the application uses the appropriate CommandInfo class to retrieve
the Bean that corresponds to the selected command, and associates the
data with that Bean using the appropriate mechanism (DataHandler,
Externalization etc.). Some CommandObjects (viewers for instance) are
subclassed from java.awt.Component and require that they are given a
parent container. Others (like a default print Command) might not
present a user interface. This allows them to be flexible enough to
function as stand alone viewer/editors, or perhaps as components in a
compound document system. The ‘application’ is responsible for providing
the proper environment (containment, life cycle, etc.) for the
CommandObject to execute in. We expect that the requirements will be
lightweight (not much beyond JavaBeans™ containers and AWT containment
for visible components).

[source, java]
----
// get the command object
Object cmdBean = cmdInfo[cmd_id].getCommandObject(dh,
				this.getClassLoader());

  ...  // use serialization/externalization where appropriate

my_awt_container.add((Component)cmdBean);
----

=== An Alternative Scenario

The first scenario was the ‘canonical’ case. There are
also circumstances where the application has already created objects to
represent its data. In this case creating an in-memory instance of a
DataSource that converted an existing object into an InputStream is an
inefficient use of system resources and can result in a loss of data
fidelity.

In these cases, the application can instantiate a
DataHandler, using the DataHandler(Object obj, String mimeType)
constructor. DataHandler implements the Transferable interface, so the
consuming Bean can request representations other than InputStreams. The
DataHandler also constructs a DataSource for consumers that request it.
The DataContentHandler mechanism is extended to also allow conversion
from Objects to InputStreams.

The following code is an example of a database front
end using Jakarta Activation, which provides query results in terms of objects.

[source, java]
----
 /**
  * Get the viewer to view my query results:
  */
 Component getQueryViewer(QueryObject qo) throws Exception {
 String mime_type = qo.getType();
 Object q_result = qo.getResultObject();
 DataHandler my_dh = new DataHandler(q_result, mime_type);

 return (Component)my_dh.getCommand(“view”).
			getCommandObject(my_dh, null));
 }
----

== Primary Framework Interfaces


This section describes interfaces required to implement the
Jakarta Activation architecture introduced in Section Three.

=== The DataSource Interface

The DataSource interface is used by the DataHandler
(and possibly other classes elsewhere) to access the underlying data.
The DataSource object encapsulates the underlying data object in a class
that abstracts the underlying data storage and typing mechanism, and
presents its consumers with a common data access interface.

Jakarta Activation provides DataSource implementations that
support file systems and URLs. Application system vendors can use the
DataSource interface to implement their own specialized DataSource
classes to support IMAP servers, object databases, or other sources.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between underlying
data items (files for instance) and DataSource objects. Also note that
the class that implements the DataSource interface is responsible for
typing the data. To manage a file system, a DataSource can use a simple
mechanism such as a file extension to type data, while a DataSource that
supports incoming web-based data can actually examine the data stream to
determine its type.

=== The DataHandler Class

The DataHandler class encapsulates a Data object, and
provides methods which act on that data.

DataHandler encapsulates the type-to-command object
binding service of the CommandMap interface for applications. It
provides a handle to the operations and data available on a data
element.

DataHandler also implements the Transferable interface.
This allows applications and applets to retrieve alternative
representations of the underlying data, in the form of objects. The
DataHandler encapsulates the interface to the component repository and
data source.

Let’s examine these groups of features in more detail:

====  Data Encapsulation

A DataHandler object can only be instantiated with
data. The data can be in the form of an object implementing the
DataSource interface (the preferred way) or as an object with an
associated content type.

Once instantiated, the DataHandler tries to provide its
data in a flexible way. The DataHandler implements the Transferable
interface which allows an object to provide alternative representations
of the data. The Transferable interface’s functionality can be extended
via objects implementing the DataContentHandler interface, and then made
available to the DataHandler either by a DataContentHandlerFactory
object, or via a CommandMap.

==== Command Binding

The DataHandler provides wrappers around commonly used
functions for command discovery. DataHandler has methods that call into
the current CommandMap associated with the DataHandler. By default the
DataHandler calls CommandMap’s getDefaultCommandMap method if no
CommandMap was explicitly set. As a convenience, DataHandler uses the
content type of its data when calls are made to the CommandMap.

=== The DataContentHandler Interface

The DataContentHandler interface is implemented by
classes that are used by the DataHandler to convert InputStreams into
objects and vice versa. In effect, the DataHandler object uses a
DataContentHandler object to implement the Transferable interface.
DataContentHandlers are discovered via the current CommandMap. A
DataContentHandler uses DataFlavors to represent the data types it can
access.

The DataContentHandler also converts data from objects
into InputStreams. For instance, if an application needs to access a
.gif file, it passes the file to the image/gif DataContentHandler. The
image/gif DataContentHandler converts the image object into a
gif-formatted byte stream.

Applications will typically need to provide
DataContentHandlers for all the MIME types they intend to support. (Note
that the Jakarta Mail implementation provides DataContentHandlers
for many of the MIME types used in mail messages.)

===  The CommandMap Interface

Once the DataHandler has a MIME type describing the
content, it can query the CommandMap for the operations, or commands
that are available for that data type. The application requests commands
available through the DataHandler and specifies a command on that list.
The DataHandler uses the CommandMap to retrieve the Bean associated with
that command. Some or all of the command map is stored in some ‘common’
place, like a .mailcap (RFC 1524) file. Other more complex
implementations can be distributed, or can provide licensing or
authentication features.

=== The CommandInfo Class

The CommandInfo class is used to represent commands in
an underlying registry. From a CommandInfo object, an application can
instantiate the Bean or request the verb (command) it describes.

=== The CommandObject Interface

Beans designed specifically for use with Jakarta Activation
should implement the CommandObject interface. This
interface provides direct access to DataHandler methods and notifies an
Activation-aware Bean which verb was used to call it. Upon instantiation, the
Bean takes a string specifying a user-selected command verb, and the
DataHandler object managing the target data. The DataHandler takes a
DataSource object, which provides an input stream linked to that data,
and a string specifying the data type.

=== The DataContentHandlerFactory

Like the ContentHandler factory in the java.net
package, the DataContentHandlerFactory is an interface that allows
developers to write objects that map MIME types to DataContentHandlers.
The interface is extremely simple, in order to allow developers as much
design and implementation freedom as possible.

== Writing Beans for the Framework


=== Overview

This section describes the specification of
well-behaved Activation-aware Bean viewers. Note that this proposal assumes the
reader is comfortable with the JavaBeans™ Specification.
Developers intending to implement viewer Beans for Jakarta Activation
should be familiar with JavaBeans™ concepts and architecture.

=== Viewer Goals

. Make the implementation of viewers and editors as
simple as implementing Beans. That is, require low cost of entry to be a
good citizen.

. Allow developers to have a certain amount of flexibility in their
implementations.

=== General

We are attempting to limit the amount of extra baggage
that needs to be implemented beyond ‘generic’ Beans. In many cases,
JavaBeans™ components that weren’t developed with knowledge of the
framework can be used. Jakarta Activation exploits the existing features of
JavaBeans™ and the JDK™, and defines as few additional interfaces and
policies as possible.

We expect that viewers/editors will be bound to data
via a simple registry mechanism similar in function to a .mailcap file.
In addition, mailcap format files may be bundled with components,
allowing additional packages to be added at runtime.

Our viewers/editors and related classes and files are
encapsulated into JAR files, as is the preferred method for JavaBeans™.
Jakarta Activation does not restrict the choice of classes used to implement
Activaiton-aware ‘viewer’ Beans, beyond those expected of well-behaved Beans.

=== Interfaces

A viewer Bean that communicates directly with a Jakarta Activation
DataHandler should implement the CommandObject interface. This interface
is small and easy to implement. However, Beans can still use standard
Serialization and Externalization methods available in the JDK.

=== Storage

Jakarta Activation expects applications and viewer Beans to
implement storage tasks via the DataSource object. However; it is
possible to use Externalization. An Activation-aware application can implement
the following storage mechanism:

[source, java]
----
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(
			data_handler.getOutputStream());
my_externalizable_bean.writeExternal(oos);
----

=== Packaging

The basic format for packaging of the Viewer/Editors is
the JAR file as described in the JavaBeans™ Specification. This format
allows the convenient packaging of collections of files that are related
to a particular Bean or applet. For more information concerning
integration points, see Section 8.

=== Container Support

Jakarta Activation is designed to be flexible enough to support
the needs of a variety of applications. Jakarta Activation expects these
applications to provide the appropriate containers and life cycle
support for these Beans. Beans written for the framework should be
compatible with the guidelines in the JavaBeans™ documentation and
should be tested against the BDK BeanBox (and the JDK Appletviewer if
they are subclassed from Applet).

=== Lifecycle

In general Jakarta Activation expects that its viewer bean life
cycle semantics are the same as those for all Beans. In the case of
Beans that implement the CommandObject interface we encourage
application developers to not parent Beans subclassed from
java.awt.Component to an AWT container until after they have called the
jakarta.activation.CommandObject.setCommandContext method.

=== Command Verbs

The MailcapCommandMap implementation provides a
mechanism that allows for an extensible set of command verbs.
Applications using Jakarta Activation can query the system for commands
available for a particular MIME type, and retrieve the Bean associated
with that MIME type.

== Framework Integration Points


This section presents several examples that clarify how
JavaBeans™ developers can write Beans that are integrated with
Jakarta Activation.

First, let’s review the pluggable components of the
Jakarta Activation framework:

* A mechanism that accesses target data where it is
stored: DataSource
* A mechanism to convert data objects to and from an
external byte stream format: DataContentHandler
* A mechanism to locate visual components that operate
on data objects: CommandMap
* The visual components that operate on data objects:
Activation-aware Beans

As a JavaBeans™ developer, you may build visual Beans.
You can also develop DataContentHandlers to supply data to those Beans.
You might also need to develop a new DataSource or CommandMap class to
access data and specify a data type.

=== Bean

Suppose you’re building a new Wombat Editor product,
with its corresponding Wombat file format. You’ve built the Wombat
Editor as one big Bean. Your WombatBean can do anything and everything
that you might want to do with a Wombat. It can edit, it can print, it
can view, it can save Wombats to files, and it can read Wombats in from
files. You’ve defined a language-independent Wombat file format. You
consider the Wombat data and file formats to be proprietary so you have
no need to offer programmatic interfaces to Wombats beyond what your
WombatBean supports.

You’ve chosen the MIME type “application/x-wombat” to
describe your Wombat file format, and you’ve chosen the filename
extension “.wom” to be used by files containing Wombats.

To integrate with the framework, you’ll need some
simple wrappers for your WombatBean for each command you want to
implement. For example, for a Print command wrapper you can write the
following code:

[source, java]
----
public class WombatPrintBean extends WombatBean {
    public WombatPrintBean() {
        super();
        initPrinting();
    }
}
----

You will need to create a mailcap file that lists the
MIME type “application/x-wombat” and user visible commands that are
supported by your WombatBean. Your WombatBean wrappers will be listed as
the objects supporting each of these commands.

[source]
----
application/x-wombat; ; x-java-view=com.foo.WombatViewBean; \
    x-java-edit=com.foo.WombatEditBean; \
    x-java-print=com.foo.WombatPrintBean
----

You’ll also need to create a mime.types file with an
entry:

[source]
----
type=application/x-wombat desc=”Wombat” exts=wom
----

All of these components are packaged in a JAR file:

[source]
----
META-INF/mailcap
META-INF/mime.types
com/foo/WombatBean.class
com/foo/WombatEditBean.class
com/foo/WombatViewBean.class
----

Because everything is built into one Bean, and because
no third party programmatic access to your Wombat objects is required,
there’s no need for a DataContentHandler. Your WombatBean can therefore
implement the Externalizable interface instead; and use its methods to
read and write your Wombat files. The DataHandler can call the
Externalizable methods when appropriate.

=== Beans

Your Wombat Editor product has really taken off, and
you’re now adding significant new functionality and flexibility to your
Wombat Editor. It’s no longer feasible to put everything into one giant
Bean. Instead, you’ve broken the product into a number of Beans and
other components:

* A WombatViewer Bean that can be used to quickly view
a Wombat in read-only mode.
* A WombatEditor Bean that is heavier than the
WombatViewer, but also allows editing.
* A WombatPrinter Bean that simply prints a Wombat.
* A component that reads and writes Wombat files.
* A Wombat class that encapsulates the Wombat data and
is used by your other Beans and components.

In addition, customers have demanded to be able to
programmatically manipulate Wombats, independently from the visual
viewer or editor Beans. You’ll need to create a DataContentHandler that
can convert a byte stream to and from a Wombat object. When reading, the
WombatDataContentHandler reads a byte stream and returns a new Wombat
object. When writing, the WombatDataContentHandler takes a Wombat object
and produces a corresponding byte stream. You’ll need to publish the API
to the Wombat class.

The WombatDataContentHandler is delivered as a class
and is designated as a DataContentHandler that can operate on Wombats in
the mailcap file included in your JAR file.

Your mailcap file changes to list the appropriate
Wombat Beans, which implement user commands:

[source]
----
application/x-wombat; ; x-java-View=com.foo.WombatViewBean; \
    x-java-edit=com.foo.WombatEditBean; \
    x-java-print=com.foo.WombatPrintBean; \
    x-java-content-handler=com.foo.WombatDataContentHandler
----

Your Wombat Beans can continue to implement the
Externalizable interface, and thus read and write Wombat byte streams.
They are more likely to simply operate on Wombat objects directly. To
find the Wombat object they’re being invoked to operate on, they
implement the CommandObject interface. The setCommandContext method
refers them to the corresponding DataHandler, from which they can invoke
the getContent method, which will return a Wombat object (produced by
the WombatDataContentHandler).

All components are packaged in a JAR file.

===  Viewer Only

The Wombat product has been wildly successful. The
ViewAll Company has decided that it can produce a Wombat viewer that’s
much faster than the WombatViewer Bean. Since they don’t want to depend
on the presence of any Wombat components, their viewer must parse the
Wombat file format, which they reverse engineered.

The ViewAll WombatViewerBean implements the
Externalizable interface to read the Wombat data format.

ViewAll delivers an appropriate mailcap file:

[source]
----
application/x-wombat; ; x-java-view=com.viewall.WombatViewer
----

and mime.types file:

[source]
----
type=application/x-wombat desc=”Wombat” exts=wom
----

All components are packaged in a JAR file.

===  ContentHandler Bean Only

Now that everyone is using Wombats, you’ve decided that
it would be nice if you could notify people by email when new Wombats
are created. You have designed a new WombatNotification class and a
corresponding data format to be sent by email using the MIME type
“application/x-wombat-notification”. Your server detects the presence of
new Wombats, constructs a WombatNotification object, and constructs and
sends an email message with the Wombat notification data as an
attachment. Your customers run a program that scans their email INBOX
for messages with Wombat notification attachments and use the
WombatNotification class to notify their users of the new Wombats.

In addition to the server application and user
application described, you’ll need a DataContentHandler to plug into the
DataHandler infrastructure and construct the WombatNotification objects.
The WombatNotification DataContentHandler is delivered as a class named
WombatNotificationDataContentHandler and is delivered in a JAR file with
the following mailcap file:

[source]
----
application/x-wombat-notification; \
    WombatNotificationDataContentHandler
----

The server application creates DataHandlers for its
WombatNotification objects. The email system uses the DataHandler to
fetch a byte stream corresponding to the WombatNotification object. (The
DataHandler uses the DataContentHandler to do this.)

The client application retrieves a DataHandler for the
email attachment and uses the getContent method to get the corresponding
WombatNotification object, which will then notify the user.



== Framework Deliverables


=== Packaging Details

Jakarta Activation is implemented as a Standard Extension to the
Java™ Platform.
The following are some more details about the package:

* The package name is jakarta.activation.
* The Jakarta Activation implementation does not include
DataContentHandlers for any MIME data types; applications must include
the DataContentHandlers they need. Note that the Jakarta Mail
implementation includes DataContentHandlers for some basic data types
used in mail messages.
* The Jakarta Activation does not include the implementation for the
following interfaces : MimeTypeRegistry, MailcapRegistry,
MailcapRegistryProvider and MimeTypeRegistryProvider.

=== Framework Core Classes

**interface DataSource:** The DataSource interface provides
Jakarta Activation with an abstraction of some arbitrary
collection of data. It provides a type for that data as well as access
to it in the form of InputStreams and OutputStreams where appropriate.

**class DataHandler:** The DataHandler class provides a
consistent interface to data available in many different sources and
formats. It manages simple stream to string conversions and related
operations using DataContentHandlers. It provides access to commands
that can operate on the data. The commands are found using a CommandMap.

**interface DataContentHandler:** The DataContentHandler
interface is implemented by objects that can be used to extend the
capabilities of the DataHandler’s implementation of the Transferable
interface. Through DataContentHandlers the framework can be extended to
convert streams in to objects, and to write objects to streams.

**interface DataContentHandlerFactory:** This interface
defines a factory for DataContentHandlers. An implementation of this
interface should map a MIME type into an instance of DataContentHandler.
The design pattern for classes implementing this interface is the same
as for the ContentHandler mechanism used in java.net.URL.

**class CommandMap:** The CommandMap class provides an
interface to the registry of viewer, editor, print, etc. objects
available in the system. Developers are expected to either use the
CommandMap implementation included with this package (MailcapCommandMap)
or develop their own. Note that some of the methods in this class are
abstract.

**interface CommandObject:** Beans that are Activation
aware implement this interface to find out which command verb
they’re being asked to perform, and to obtain the DataHandler
representing the data they should operate on. Beans that don’t implement
this interface may be used as well. Such commands may obtain the data
using the Externalizable interface, or using an application-specific
method.

**class CommandInfo:** The CommandInfo class is used by
CommandMap implementations to describe the results of command requests.
It provides the requestor with both the verb requested, as well as an
instance of the bean. There is also a method that will return the name
of the class that implements the command but it is not guaranteed to
return a valid value. The reason for this is to allow CommandMap
implementations that subclass CommandInfo to provide special behavior.
For example a CommandMap could dynamically generate Beans. In this case,
it might not be possible to create an object with all the correct state
information solely from the class name.

=== Framework Auxiliary Classes

**class FileDataSource:** The FileDataSource class
implements a simple DataSource object that encapsulates a file. It
provides data typing services via a FileTypeMap object.

**class FileTypeMap:** The FileTypeMap is an abstract class
that provides a data typing interface for files. Implementations of this
class will implement the getContentType methods which will derive a
content type from a file name or a File object. FileTypeMaps could use
any scheme to determine the data type, from examining the file extension
of a file (like the MimetypesFileTypeMap) to opening the file and trying
to derive its type from the contents of the file. The FileDataSource
class uses the default FileTypeMap (a MimetypesFileTypeMap unless
changed) to determine the content type of files.

**class MimetypesFileTypeMap:** This class extends
FileTypeMap and provides data typing of files via their file extension.
It uses the .mime.types format.

**class URLDataSource:** The URLDataSource class provides
an object that wraps a URL object in a DataSource interface.
URLDataSource simplifies the handling of data described by URLs within
Jakarta Activation because this class can be used to
create new DataHandlers.

**class MailcapCommandMap:** MailcapCommandMap extends the
CommandMap abstract class. It implements a CommandMap whose
configuration is based on mailcap files (RFC 1524). The
MailcapCommandMap can be configured both programmatically and via
configuration files.

**class ActivationDataFlavor:** The ActivationDataFlavor is
a special subclass of java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor. It allows
Jakarta Activation to set all three values stored by the DataFlavor
class via a new constructor as well as improved MIME parsing in the
equals method.
Except for the improved parsing, its semantics are identical to that of
the JDK’s DataFlavor class.

**class UnsupportedDataTypeException:** Signals that
requested operation does not support the requested data type.

**class MimeType:** A Multipurpose Internet Extension
(MIME) type, as defined in RFC 2045 and 2046.

== Provider Requirements

Jakarta Activation provider has to implement following interfaces :

**interface MailcapRegistry:** The MailcapRegistry is used to store
and retrieve MailcapEntries. Provider must implement
MailcapRegistryProvider to create new instances of the MailcapRegistry.
Implementation of the MailcapRegistry can store MailcapEntries in
different ways and that storage must be accessible through the
methods of the MailcapRegistryProvider. Implementation of the
MailcapRegistry must contain in-memory storage for MailcapEntries.

**interface MailcapRegistryProvider:** This interface defines a factory
for MailcapRegistry. Jakarta Activation uses Service Provider Interface
and ServiceLoader to obtain an instance of the implementation of the
MailcapRegistryProvider.

**interface MimeTypeRegistry:** The MimeTypeRegistry interface is used
to store and retrieve MimeTypeEntries. Provider must implement
MimeTypeRegistryProvider to create new instances of the MimeTypeRegistry.
Implementation of the MimeTypeRegistry can store MimeTypeEntries in
different ways and that storage must be accessible through the methods
of the MimeTypeRegistryProvider. Implementation of the MimeTypeRegistry
must contain in-memory storage for MimeTypeEntries.

**interface MimeTypeRegistryProvider:** This interface defines a factory
for MimeTypeRegistry. Jakarta Activation uses Service Provider Interface
and ServiceLoader to obtain an instance of the implementation of the
MimeTypeRegistryProvider.
