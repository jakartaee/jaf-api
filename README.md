# Jakarta Activation

[![Build Status](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/actions/workflows/maven.yml?branch=master)
[![Jakarta Staging (Snapshots)](https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/https/jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/jakarta.activation/jakarta.activation-api.svg)](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/jakarta/activation/jakarta.activation-api/)

Jakarta Activation lets you take advantage of standard services to:
determine the type of arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to
it; discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the
appropriate bean to perform the operation(s).

**IMPORTANT:** Implementation of the Jakarta Activation API, aka JakartaActivation
(formerly JavaActivation), is no longer part of this repository.
As part of breaking tight integration between Jakarta Activation API and the implementation,
implementation sources were moved to the new project - [Eclipse Angus](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/angus-activation) -
and further development continues there. [Eclipse Angus](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/angus-activation)
is direct accessor of JavaActivation/JakartaActivation.
